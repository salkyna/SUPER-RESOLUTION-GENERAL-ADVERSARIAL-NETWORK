# SUPER-RESOLUTION-GENERAL-ADVERSARIAL-NETWORK

In this project, we generate super-resolution images from low-resolution images, with finer details and higher quality using SRGAN with Keras.

The following are the steps to set up the project:

1. Create a python virtual environment and activate it
2. Install dependencies using "pip install -r requirements.txt"
3. Create essential folders like 1. logs 2. results 3. data
4. Download 'img_align_celeba.zip' from "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7EVK8r0v71pTUZsaXdaSnZBZzg"
5. Train the model by executing "python3 main.py"
